                      CALL FOR WORKSHOP PARTICIPATION

                              PARTS AND WHOLES:
            CONCEPTUAL PART-WHOLE RELATIONS AND FORMAL MEREOLOGY

                           Monday, August 8, 1994
                         Amsterdam, The Netherlands

                           Held in conjunction with
                                  ECAI-94
           (11th European Conference  on  Artificial  Intelligence)


   Currently, there are two main approaches to the study of "parts" and
their relations. The conceptual (cognitive) approach looks at the variety
of part-whole relations and their role in language processing, perception,
and action planning; the philosophical/logical approach, on the other hand,
looks at formal theories of parts, wholes and related concepts in the
framework of formal ontology.

   There are important differences between the two views. Philosophical
systems tend to focus on a single "part-*of*" relation used for modeling
ontological domains like time, space, or pluralities; conceptual approaches
tend to assume a whole family of different "part-*whole*" relations for a
variety of entities and tasks. Classical logical theories such as Lesniewski's
or Goodman's privileged extensional aspects of the part-wholerelation, while
for conceptual approaches and intensional formal mereology the old proverb
holds that a whole is more than its parts.

   While disciplines such as linguistics, philosophy and psychology have
contributed significantly to the research in this field, their impact on
artificial intelligence is extremely limited, although AI could represent
the ideal workbench for a unification of approaches dominant in different
fields. Knowledge about parts is of great importance for a wide variety of AI
domains, like vision, qualitative and naive physics, robotics, and natural
language processing. For example, the structure of an object can be used
for visual recognition, for reasoning about the functionality of the whole,
or for planning its assembly.

   The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from these
various disciplines in order to explore

   (i)   the benefits and limits of formal mereology in modeling commonsense
         part-whole relations;
   (ii)  the import for knowledge representation formalisms of the two
         current approaches to the study of "parts" and their relations;
   (iii) the possibility of a unified theory of parts and wholes.

   The workshop topics will include the following:

- Classical extensional mereology: uses, extensions and adaptations;
  comparison with alternatives to mereology: set theory and lattices.
- Intensional mereology: essence, dependence, and integrity; individual
  properties as parts.
- Conceptual distinctions among wholes: masses, collections, complexes;
  natural entities and artifacts; sums and scattered individuals.
- Parts and structure: physical connection, spatial, temporal, functional
  and other constraints among parts; Gestalt theories and perceptual parts;
  granularity issues.
- Parts, space and time: relationships between mereology, topology,
  geometry; boundaries and surfaces; relationships between parts of physical
  objects (continuants) and parts of events (occurrents).
- Parts and natural language: parts, part-names and possessive constructions;
  plurals and mass terms.
- Reasoning about parts: transitivity, upper and downward inheritance of
  properties.
- Dealing with parts within existing KR formalisms: distinguishing parts
  from other attributes, computational issues of reasoning about parts.

Two possible kinds of contributions are solicited from interested
participants:

   (a) regular papers of 10 pages max, presenting on-going research;
   (b) position papers of 3 pages max, motivating the interest in the field
       and explaining particular points of view.

A limited number of regular papers will be chosen for an oral presentation
at the workshop, while suitable space will be devoted to discussions based
on contributions from participants (rejected regular papers are
automatically treated as position papers). Participation will be limited to
around 35 people.

Preference will be given in the workshop schedule to contributions
underlining the impact of mereological issues on AI practice, especially
on: knowledge representation, natural language processing, qualitative and
naive physics, spatial and temporal reasoning, vision, and robotics.

Submission of papers, regular and position, to any member of the workshop
organizing committee is due by April 15 1994. Hard copy (4 copies) and
electronic submissions (either PostScript, LaTex or MacWord converted
in BinHex
format) are equally acceptable, with a strong preference for the latter.
All submissions should include an exact address and an e-mail address.

GRAMMATICAL INFERENCE COLLOQUIUM

    Grammatical  Inference  (GI) is broadly understood as the task of
 learning 
grammars from data. Traditionally, GI has been studied within several
contexts:
Information Theory, Formal  Language Theory, Computational
Linguistics, Machine
Learning,  Pattern Recognition,  Computational  Learning  and  Neural
Networks,
to name but a  few.  This  multidisciplinary perspective, however, 
has lead so
far to a lack of a focussed research community. A first attempt to
correct this
started  with  the   "First  Colloquium  on   Grammatical  Inference:
  Theory,
Applications and Alternatives" held in the University of Essex
(U.K.), in April
1993. Following the success  of this  colloquium, the ICGI-94  aims
to  provide
a forum for  discussion  of  principles,  theory and  applications of
all those
aspects of  Automatic Learning that explicitly focus on Grammars and
Languages.
Within this  framework, topics of  interest include, but are not
limited to the
following:
	  - Theory and Algorithms.
	  - Learning Paradigms (Identification in the limit, PAC-Learning,
	    Stochastic Approaches, Genetic Algorithms).
	  - Pattern Recognition. 
	  - Neural Networks.
	  - Computational Linguistics.
	  - Machine Learning.
	  - Applications to Natural Language Processing, Language Translation,
	    Sequence Learning and Prediction, Speech and Image
Processing, Gene
	    Analysis, Cryptography, etc.


INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

Subject: CPF -- 3D Interaction Workshop at CHI '94
Date: Tuesday, 15 February 1994 4:36PM

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:
 
                Workshop on the Challenges of 3D Interaction
                           CHI '94, Boston, Mass.
             April 24-25, 1994 (2 days prior to main conference)
 
 
ORGANIZERS:
        Kenneth Herndon, Brown University
        Andries van Dam, Brown University
        Michael Gleicher, Carnegie Mellon University
 
THEME:
Challenges of 3D interaction and 3D user interfaces, including design
considerations, implementation and evaluation; Tools for designing and
building 3D interfaces.
 
 
GOALS:
The primary goal of this workshop is to help define principles and
techniques for the design, implementation and evaluation of future 3D
user interfaces.  These interfaces must address many challenges
arising from such sources as users' perceptual and cognitive skills
and abilities, limitations of currently available input and output
devices, the nature of 3D tasks and the variety of implementation
strategies and development environments.
 
This workshop will explore these challenges so that we can more
effectively design, implement, and evaluate new user interfaces,
appraise the tools used to build 3D interfaces, and identify key areas
of research.  To discuss these challenges in adequate depth will
require diverse expertise among the participants of this workshop.  We
therefore hope to gather researchers from many disciplines to discuss
the following topics:
 
  + Challenges in the design and evaluation of 3D interfaces:
     What makes 3D interfaces difficult?  Are they intrinsically harder to
     design than 2D ones?  What characteristics must 3D interfaces have to
     exploit the perceptual and spatial reasoning skills of users?  How
     should we evaluate the usability of 3D interfaces?  Do virtual and
     augmented-reality applications provide any opportunities or challenges
     different from conventional desktop 3D applications?
 
  + Challenges in specifying and constructing 3D interfaces:
     How do the strategies used for constructing 2D interfaces apply in 3D?
     How do they fail?  How can the expertise of other disciplines such as
     industrial design apply?  What kinds of tools and environments can
     help the process?
 
  + The current state of the art in 3D interfaces:}
     What is the state of the art today?  What challenges were encountered
     in creating these interfaces?  How well do current interfaces meet the
     challenges above?  What common denominators are emerging?
 
  + The future of 3D interface technology:}
     How can we create better 3D interfaces?  What can we do to make the
     design, implementation and evaluation of 3D interfaces easier?
 
 
 
PLANNED WORKSHOP ACTIVITIES
 
The first day of the workshop will be devoted to discussing 3D user
interfaces from a user's point of view.  Participants will present
research work relating to this theme for 10-15 minutes.  Presentations
will be followed by short question-and-answer periods, but in-depth
discussion will be postponed until all have had an opportunity to
speak.  After all the presentations, we will discuss the salient
issues concerning the challenges of 3D interfaces outlined above.  We
will then attempt to identify some principles and define research
topics for 3D user interface design.
 
The second day of the workshop will focus on 3D user interfaces from
the implementer's point of view.  The same format as the first day
will be followed in order to provide an opportunity to discuss and
critique one another's other's work.  We will attempt to identify
commonalities among the approaches to designing and implementing the
various user interfaces presented, and aim to propose a set of
research topics and a more standardized methodology for continuing to
explore the field.  Not all participants are expected to present both
days.
 
We hope to have 15 to 20 participants so that everyone has a chance to
present their ideas and have an adequate discussion of them.
 
 
 
SUBMISSION:
 
Participants are requested to submit a short (3-5 page) position
statement describing your relevant experience with 3D interfaces and
what you would present at the workshop.
 
Send 3 copies of the statement to:

Summary of Key Dates:

 Deadline for submission: 31st March 1994

 Acceptance Notification by: 1st June 1994 

 Camera-ready copy due: 1st August 1994

 Early registration by: 14th August 1994



Background: In recent years there has been a steadily increasing
 interest in alternative theories and methodologies to the mainstream
 techniques of symbolic computational linguistics.  This international
 conference will provide a forum for researchers in the broad area of
 new methods in NLP, i.e., symbolic and non-symbolic techniques of
 analogy-based, statistical, and connectionist processing, to present
 their most recent research and to discuss its implications.  In order
 to focus the conference, however, it is intended to concentrate on
 research primarily involving written NLP.  It is also hoped that the
 conference will promote discussion in general terms of what this
 branch of NLP hopes to achieve and how far this paradigm can take NLP
 in the future.

 Particular areas of interest to the conference include the following:


 * Example- and Memory-based MT
 * Corpus-based NLP
 * Bootstrapping techniques
 * Analogy-based NLP
 * Connectionist NLP
 * Statistical MT/NLP
 * Theoretical issues of sub-symbolic vs. symbolic NLP
 * Hybrid approaches

 University), Royal Skousen (Brigham Young University), Jun-ichi Tsujii
 (UMIST), Susan Warwick-Armstrong (ISSCO), Yorick Wilks (Sheffield
 University).


Location and Dates: The conference will be held in Manchester at
 UMIST from Wednesday 14th to Friday 16th September 1994 (inclusive).

Registration: Registration before 14th August will be 30 pounds. A fee
 of 45 pounds will be charged for late registration. The registration

                    Reasoning with Shapes in Design
                    ===============================
 
                       Sunday, August 14th, 1994
                             14:00--18:00 hs

                        Lausanne, Switzerland             

                   Held in conjunction with  AID'94
               (Artificial Intelligence in Design '94)
  

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

   'Shape' -- models of geometry -- plays an important role in the
development of design ideas. This workshop will provide a forum 
for researchers in artificial intelligence in design to discuss
reasoning with shape in design and the representations and
computations that support such reasoning.

The workshop organisers especially invite attention to the following
issues:

 * designers' understanding of shape information
 * the role of shape information in different models of design
      (examples of design models include search, constraints,
       prototypes, optimisation, and genetic processes)
 * models of shapes
 * representations of shapes
      (emerging representational schemes such as connectionist and 
       diagrammatic representations as well as traditional symbolic 
       representations, including mathematical ones, are of interest)
 * reasoning with shapes
 * transformations between alternative representations of shapes
 * computing with shapes
 * design applications involving shape

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

    The workshop will have a round-table format. Up to four 
20-minute presentations based on extended abstracts submitted by
participants will be given. Its duration will be 4 hours with 
a half hour break at the midpoint.  The presentations are intended to
act as catalysts for discussion which can and should go beyond 
the presentations themselves.

Attendance
----------

Attendance at the workshop will be restricted to persons whose
extended abstracts are accepted by the advisory
committee. To help ensure a focussed and collegial atmosphere, the 
number of attendees will be limited to 20-30 people.
Participants must register for both the workshop and the
general conference. The workshop fee will be SFr 75. This is to 
cover administration,  workshop notes and coffee break.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should be
directed to either of the coordinators.


Submissions Requirements
------------------------

Submit an extended abstract of 2-5 pages. Authors whose abstracts are
selected by the advisory committee for presentation will be requested
to prepare 20-minute presentations of their work.

Send submissions in plain ascii or Latex source format to
jose@arch.su.edu.au, or mail 4 copies of hardcopy submissions to Jose
Damski at the address below.  Electronic submissions are preferred.
Please do not send floppy disks or tapes.

Important Dates
---------------

 2 June 1994  Deadline for submissions.
 4 July 1994  Notification of acceptance.
15 July 1994  Deadline for camera-ready copies.

Publication
------------

The preprints of the workshop will be published, and distributed to the
participants at the workshop. Authors of some abstracts may subsequently
be invited to submit a full paper to a special issue of an archival 
journal related to the topic of reasoning with shapes.

theories and on the theoretical issues involved in the development of
natural language processing systems. Papers are sought in areas
which include, but are not limited to, the following topics:
*        ambiguous formal representations
*        the use of context in interpretation
*        dynamic logic and natural language
*        semantic automata
*        the semantics-pragmatics interface

		     EACL-95  CALL FOR PAPERS

    7th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
	           Computational Linguistics

			March 27--29, 1995
		    University College Dublin
		    Belfield, Dublin, Ireland


Topics of Interest:

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research
on all aspects of computational linguistics, including, but not
limited to, pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax, and the lexicon;
phonetics, phonology, and morphology; interpreting and generating
spoken and written language; linguistic, mathematical, and
psychological models of language; language-oriented information
retrieval; corpus-based language modeling; machine translation and
translation aids; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
message and narrative understanding systems; and theoretical and
applications papers of every kind.


Requirements:

Papers should describe unique work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work; and they should indicate clearly the
state of completion of the reported results.  A paper accepted for
presentation at the EACL Meeting cannot be presented or have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings.  Papers that are being submitted to other conferences must
reflect this fact on the title page.


Format for Submission:

Authors should submit preliminary versions of their papers, not to
exceed 3200 words (exclusive of references).  Papers outside the
specified length and formatting requirements are subject to rejection
without review.  Papers should be headed by a title page containing
the paper title, a short (5 line) summary and a specification of the
subject area.  Since reviewing will be "blind", the title page of the
paper should omit author names and addresses.  Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the authors' identity (e.g., "We
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...") should be avoided. Instead, use
references like "Smith previously showed (1991) ..."  Care should be
taken to mask identity in the bibliography by referring to the
author's own papers as anonymous.  This is especially applicable of
unpublished in-house technical reports which are certain to reveal the
identity of the author(s).

To identify each paper, a separate identification page should be
supplied, containing the paper's title, the name(s) of the author(s),
complete addresses, a short (5 line) summary, a word count, and a
specification of the topic areas.

Submission Media: 

Papers should be submitted electronically or in hard copy to the
Program Chair:

Erhard W. Hinrichs 
Universitaet Tuebingen
Seminar fuer Sprachwissenschaft
Abt. Computerlinguistik
Kleine Wilhelmstr. 113
D-72074 Tuebingen, Germany

email: eacl95@sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de
phone: +49--7071-294279

Electronic submissions should be either self-contained LaTeX source or
plain text.  LaTeX submissions must use the ACL submission style
(aclsub.sty) retrievable from the ACL LISTSERV server (access to which
is described below) and should not refer to any external files or
styles except for the standard styles for TeX 3.14 and LaTeX 2.09.  A
model submission modelsub.tex is also provided in the archive, as well
as a bibliography style acl.bst. (Note however that the bibliography
for a submission cannot be submitted as separate .bib file; the actual
bibliography entries must be inserted in the submitted LaTeX source
file.)

Hard copy submissions should consist of four (4) copies of the paper
and one (1) copy of the identification page.  For both kinds of
submissions, if at all possible, a plain text version of the
identification page should be sent separately by electronic mail,
using the following format:

title: < title >
author: < name of first author >
address: < address of first author >
.... 
author: < name of last author >
address: < address of last author >
abstract: < abstract >
content areas: first area >, ... ,< last area >
word count:


Schedule: 

Authors must submit their papers by October 20, 1994.  Papers received
after this date will not be considered. Notification of receipt will
be mailed to the first author (or designated author) soon after
receipt.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by December 23rd
1994.  Camera-ready copies of final papers prepared in a double-column
format, preferably using a laser printer, must be received by 31
January 1995, along with a signed copyright release statement.  The
ACL LaTeX proceedings format is available through the ACL LISTSERV.


Other Activities: 

The meeting will include a program of tutorials coordinated by John
Nerbonne, Alfa-informatica, Oude Kijk in 't Jatstraat 26, Postbus 716,
Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, NL-9700 AS Groningen; email:
nerbonne@let.rug.nl.

Some of the ACL Special Interest Groups may arrange workshops or other
activities.  Further information may be available from the ACL
LISTSERV.


Conference Information: 

The Local Arrangements Committee is chaired by:

Allan Ramsay,
Department of Computer Science, 
University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland
(phone: (353)-1-7062479, FAX: (353)-1-2687262, email: allan@monkey.ucd.ie)

ACL Information: 

For other information on the ACL more generally, contact Judith
Klavans (global) or Mike Rosner (for Europe): Judith Klavans, Columbia
University, Computer Science, Room 724, New York, NY 10027, USA;
phone: +1-212-939-7120, fax: +1-914-478-1802;
email:acl@cs.columbia.edu; Michael Rosner, IDSIA, Corso Elvezia 36,
CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland, email: mike@idsia.uu.ch.  General
information about the ACL AND electronic membership and order forms
are available from the ACL LISTSERV.

Information on the ACL is also available through www URL
http://www.cc.columbia.edu/~acl/home.html

Participants from Eastern Europe:

There may be subsidies to enable participants from Eastern Europe to
attend the
conference. Contact Allan Ramsay at the address above for more information.


ACL Listserv: 

LISTSERV is a facility to allow access to an electronic document
archive by electronic mail.  The ACL LISTSERV has been set up at
Columbia University's Department of Computer Science. Requests from
the archive should be sent as e-mail messages to

listserver@cs.columbia.edu

with an empty subject field and the message body containing the
request command.  The most useful requests are "help" for general help
on using LISTSERV, "index acl-l" for the current contents of the ACL
archive and "get acl-l <file>" to get a particular file named <file>
from the archive.  For example, to get an ACL membership form, a
message with the following body should be sent:

get acl-l membership-form.txt

Answers to requests are returned by e-mail.  Since the server may have
many requests for different archives to process, requests are queued
up and may take a while (say, overnight) to be fulfilled.

The ACL archive can also be accessed by anonymous FTP. Here is an
example of how to get the same file by FTP (user type-in is in bold):

$ ftp ftp.cs.columbia.edu
Name (cs.columbia.edu:pereira): anonymous
Password: pereira@research.att.com << not echoed
ftp > cd acl-l/Information
ftp > get 94.membership.form.Z
ftp > quit
$ uncompress 94membership.form.Z

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS
December 19-21, 1994, Tilburg, The Netherlands

The Institute for Language Technology and Artificial Intelligence will host a
Workshop on Computational Semantics that will take place in Tilburg,
The Netherlands, from 19 - 21 December 1994. The aim of the workshop
is to bring together researchers involved in all aspects of computational
semantics of natural language.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

The workshop will focus on the computational aspects of formal semantic
theories and on the theoretical issues involved in the development of
natural language processing systems. Papers are sought in areas
which include, but are not limited to, the following topics:
*        ambiguous formal representations
*        the use of context in interpretation
*        dynamic logic and natural language
*        semantic automata
*        the semantics-pragmatics interface
*        incremental interpretation
*        interpretation and inference
*        algorithmic aspects of interpretation
*        constructive type theory and natural language interpretation

All submitted papers will be refereed by an international programme committee.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Authors are asked to submit an original paper of maximally 10 pages by Monday
August 15, 1994. We strongly encourage papers to be electronically
submitted. In this case they should be in LaTeX format (a LaTeX style
sheet (iwcs.sty) can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
itkwww.kub.nl, in the directory /pub/iwcs) and should be
emailed to:

Computational.Semantics@kub.nl

If electronic submission in this form is impossible, four hard copies of the
paper, preferably prepared with LaTeX, should be sent to:

                        ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
 
SIGIR'95 is an international research conference on information retrieval
theory, systems, and applications.  The ACM SIGIR conference occurs
annually, alternating between locations in North America and elsewhere
(e.g., Europe).  This conference will interest a broad spectrum of
professionals including theoreticians, developers, publishers,
researchers, educators, and designers of systems, interfaces, information
bases, and related applications.
 
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the First Society in
Computing, is a major force in advancing the skills and knowledge of IT
professionals and students throughout the world.  ACM serves as an
umbrella organization offering its 90,000 members a variety of forums in
order to fulfill its members' needs -- the delivery of cutting-edge
technical information, the transfer of ideas from theory to practice, and
opportunities for information exchange.  Providing high quality products
and services -- world-class journals and magazines; dynamic special
interest groups; numerous "main event" conferences;  tutorials; workshops;
local special interest groups and chapters; and electronic forums -- ACM
is the resource for life-long learning in the rapidly changing IT field.

                                PAPERS
 
SIGIR'95 seeks papers about significant contributions to the broad field of
information storage and retrieval, which covers: handling of all types of
information; its applications; information systems; and underlying theories,
models, and implementations.
 
We encourage discussions of experimental studies, tests of usability,
explorations of information-retrieval behavior, reports on large scale
system performance, and demonstrations of advanced approaches.  We prefer:
that contributions that discuss theory have sufficient motivation and
proof of utility; that designs have been proven by a prototype; that
reports on small-scale experiments include convincing arguments or
simulations to show their likelihood to generalize; and that writing is
carefully copy edited and well organized.
 
All papers shall provide a concise message to the audience about how the
work relates to previous research or experience, what aspects of the work
are new, and the "lessons learned."  Papers will be evaluated on the basis
of originality, significance of the contribution to the field, quality of
research, and quality of writing.
 
Papers shall be submitted in English to the relevant Program Co-chair.
Specific submission requirements:
 
(a) Papers shall be submitted in four copies.
 
(b) Papers must include an abstract of not more than 100 words.
 
(c) Papers must be 20 pages or less (double spaced), including abstract,
        figures, and references.  Final versions of accepted papers may
        require further trimming to meet publication standards.
 
(d) Authors shall provide a separate cover page (not included in the length
        limitations) with the title, the author name(s), and the author
        affiliation(s), plus complete contact information (mailing address,
        telephone, FAX, and e-mail) for the author to whom correspondence
        should be send.
 
(e) Show the word count for the paper on the cover page.
 
(f) Indicate if the paper is to be considered for the Best Student Paper
        Award. This Award requires that the first and primary author be a
        full-time student at time of submission.
 
 
                                TUTORIALS
 
SIGIR'95 will begin with a full day of tutorials, each of which is
intended to cover a single topic in detail.  Proposals are solicited from
people willing to give tutorials. Tutorials may be either a half day (4
hours) or full day in length and can cover topics at an introductory or
advanced level. Submissions shall be made to the Tutorials and Panels
Chair and shall consist of:
 
  (a) An extended abstract outlining the exact content of the tutorial.
        This should be approximately 3 to 5 pages in length. Sample slides
        would also be helpful.
 
  (b) Tutorial Length: half-day or full day.
 
  (c) A description of the intended audience outlining what attendees are
        expected to know,  the technical level of the tutorial and the
        objectives of the tutorial.
 
  (d) A CV for each presenter detailing relevant qualifications and
        experience. Some biographical details may also be helpful.
 
  (e) A complete description of A/V and computer equipment required for the
        tutorial.
 
  (f) Complete address for the presenter(s), including phone, FAX and e-mail
        addresses.
 
E-mail submissions shall be in plain ASCII text.
 
 
                                   PANELS
 
SIGIR'95 will include a small number of panel sessions. These are intended
to examine issues of interest to the research and development community
and stimulate lively debate between panelists and audience members.
Presentations by panel members should lay the groundwork and open the
debate. Ideally the panel shall consist of 4 members, with very divergent
views on the topic. The moderator shall referee the debate, ensuring a
good balance in the discussion without presenting a position.  Proposals
are solicited from moderators and/or panelists.  Submissions shall be made
to the Tutorials and Panels Chair and shall consist of:
 
(a) An extended abstract outlining the proposed topic, including the questions
        likely to arise.
 
(b) A list of panel members and the name of a moderator.
 
(c) A CV for each panelist and the moderator, detailing relevant
        qualifications and experience.  Some biographical details may also be
        helpful.
 
(e) Complete addresses for the moderator and panelists, including phone, FAX
        and e-mail addresses.
 
E-mail submissions shall be in plain ASCII text.
 
 
                            DEMONSTRATIONS
 
Demonstrations provide an opportunity for first-hand, interactive
experience with information retrieval systems.  Researchers and developers
have the opportunity to present their new systems, and conference
participants have the opportunity to interact directly with creators of
the systems demonstrated.
 
We invite proposals for demonstrations of information retrieval systems
and applications.  Demonstrations should focus on aspects of the system
that are novel and important. Demonstrations are not limited to
experimental systems only. IR researchers participating in the NIST/ARPA
sponsored TREC, MUC, TIPSTER projects and the European Community research
initiatives are encouraged to participate.
 
Presenters of the systems must be individuals who have been directly
involved with the development of the system, and who are aware of the
differentiating and interesting ideas embodied in their system.  All
presenters are expected to register for the conference.
 
Presenters shall submit a proposal of at most three pages, describing the
planned demonstration, to the Demonstration Chair.  The proposal shall
include:
 
(a) A description of noteworthy and distinguishing ideas or approaches the
        demonstration will illustrate.
 
(b) An explanation of how the demonstration will illustrate these ideas or
        approaches.
 
(c) Complete contact information (mailing address, telephone, FAX, and
        e-mail) and affiliation of the person(s) who will present the
        demonstration, including their relationship to the project (e.g.,
        principal investigator, developer, project manager, architect).
 
(d) A 100-word summary for inclusion in the conference's preliminary program.
 
(e) A description of the technical specifications of the system.  The selected
        presenters shall provide a description that is modeled after the TREC
        technical specification descriptions.  An electronic form will be
        available via e-mail.
 
(f) A bibliography of published and unpublished materials that relate to the
        system, its algorithms and underlying theories as well as any
        evaluations that have been undertaken.
 
(g) The hardware, software, and network requirements for the demonstration,
        including the electrical requirements of the equipment.
 
No FAX submissions; e-mail submissions preferred.
 
 
                                POSTERS
 
SIGIR '95 will include poster presentations to enable researchers an
opportunity to present late-breaking results, significant work in
progress, or research that is best communicated in conversational mode.
Poster presenters will have the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one
with attendees and to discuss their work in detail with those most deeply
interested in the same topic.
 
Posters will be reviewed by appropriate subject specialists as well as the
Program Committee, and will be selected on the basis of their contribution
to research-focused discussion. Posters will be accepted a full month
later than papers in order to provide an opportunity for submitting very
current work that need not be written up in a full paper.
 
Abstracts of posters will appear in the conference proceedings.  There
will be a specific time during the conference when authors will be
expected to be present at their posters to describe their work and answer
questions, but posters will also be accessible for informal viewing
throughout the day.
 
Doctoral students are encouraged to consider poster submission as a viable
means for discussing ongoing dissertation research.
 
Submissions shall be made to the Posters Chair and shall consist of:
 
(a) Abstract, submitted in three copies.
 
(b) An extended abstract of approximately three to four pages.
 
(c) Abstract shall emphasize the research problem, the approach or methodology
        being used, and why the work is important.
 
(d) A separate cover page with the title of the poster, the name and
        affiliation of the author(s)/presenter(s), as well as complete contact
        information to include postal address, email address, phone number
        and FAX number of the author(s).
 
 
                                WORKSHOPS
 
Proposals are being solicited from both individuals and groups for one-day
workshops to be held on July 13.  Workshops bring together researchers to
share information and discuss a topic that relates to their expertise.
Submissions shall be made to the Workshops Chair and shall be limited to 3
pages.  They shall contain:
 
(a) The theme and goal of the workshop.
 
(b) The planned activities.
 
(c) A CV for each organizer detailing relevant qualifications and
        experience (not included in the length limitations).  Some
        biographical details may also be helpful.
 
(d)  Maximum number of participants.
 
(e)  Process for selecting participants.
 
(f)  List of potential participants.
 
After the workshop, organizers will provide an article summarizing the
workshop for SIGIR Forum.
 
No FAX submissions.

PACLING '95
Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics 
2nd Conference

April 19-22 (Wed-Sat) 1995 
The University of Queensland 
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia



********************
* HISTORY AND AIMS *
********************

PACLING (= Pacific Association for Computational 
LINGuistics) has grown out of the very successful Japan-
Australia joint symposia on natural language processing 
(NLP) held in November 1989 in Melbourne, Australia and in 
October 1991 in Iizuka City, Japan. The first meeting of 
the retitled PACLING, a name designed to express the wider 
membership, took place in Vancouver, Canada in April 1993.

PACLING '95 will be a low-profile, high-quality, workshop-
oriented meeting whose aim is to promote friendly 
scientific relations among Pacific Rim countries, with 
emphasis on interdisciplinary scientific exchange showing 
openness towards good research falling outside current 
dominant "schools of thought," and on technological 
transfer within the Pacific region. The conference is a 
unique forum for scientific and technological exchange, 
being smaller than ACL, COLING or Applied NLP, and also 
more regional with extensive representation from the 
Western Pacific (as well as the Eastern).

   University of Sunderland
   U.K.

   First Call for Papers

   Objectives

   This meeting aims to:

   -	promote a better understanding of information retrieval tasks
	   and technologies amongst the speech and language communities;

   -	provide a conduit for the communication experience gained from
	   participation in US-based initiatives (MUC, TREC) to a wider 
	   British and European audience;

   -	produce a strengthened pool of expertise in these important 
	   application areas for speech and language technologies.


   Background

   In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the use 
   of automatic speech and language processing to enhance the
   effectiveness of computer systems which retrieve, for example,
   specific text financial reports from databases of such articles 
   or which produce summaries of incoming electronic mail messages. 
   This interest is exemplified by (or perhaps triggered by) the 
   MUC, TREC and TIPSTER initiatives in the U.S.  There is now growing
   interest in promoting parallel initiative on a Europe-wide 
   multi-lingual basis, and also on U.K. specific initiatives.

   The U.K. Speech and Language Technology Committee therefore 
   determined that it was timely to organise a meeting on this 
   topic within the U.K.

   Topics

   papers are invited on Topic Extraction, Mail Routing, Medical 
   Informatics, SDI, Indexing, Retrieval from Large Knowledge Bases, 
   Multi-media, text and other databases, evaluation of
   these technologies and related technologies.


   Form of Meeting

   The meeting will consist of a number of invited talks from 
   leading people in the field, together with submitted papers from 
   other who can contributed towards the achievement of
   the objectives.

   In order to promote inter-communication between the various elements
   of the community there will be no parallel sessions.


   Submission Details

   Intending authors should submit an abstract of no more than 500 words 
   either by Electronic Mail (plain ASCII text only please) or paper to:

   Dr. J.I. Tait
   Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing

   From whom further details may be obtained.

   Deadline for submission: 1 November 1994
   Decision on inclusion announced by: 1 December 1994

   Abstracts of Papers presented at the meeting will be included in the
   meeting proceedings.

Subject: Multimedia workshop
Date: Thursday, 29 September 1994 3:29PM

Anne's message reminds me that I have an activity I've been
cooking up for some weeks, which is now about ready to be
advertised.  So here goes.  Spread this around as you see fit.
It may not be directly diversification, but with any luck it
will help with generating useful contacts through the IISIG
and through the fact that it is explicitly supported by BT.

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

IMMI-1

First International Workshop on Intelligence and Multimodality in
Multimedia Interfaces: Research and Applications

Human Communication Research Centre
and
EdCAAD, Dept. of Architecture

University of Edinburgh
Edinburgh, Scotland
Thursday 13th - Friday 14th July 1995


Arranged on behalf of:

UK Dept. of Trade and Industry (DTI) Intelligent Systems Integration
Programme: Special Interest Group on Intelligent Interfaces (IISIG)

In cooperation with the AAAI

and in association with The HCI Group (a specialist group of the BCS)

ACL SIGMEDIA

BT


Multimedia is hailed as the next great step forward in interface
technology.  But the potential of this technology depends on a
greater understanding of how to exploit it more dynamically and
interactively.  Bringing ``intelligence'' into multimedia
interfaces is thus increasingly important.  This Workshop seeks
to assess progress and examine pointers for future research and
development directions; it seeks also to highlight issues arising
from experience of real multimedia applications, and hence
encourages reports from practice.

Contributions are invited concerning all kinds of work in the area.
Themes include (but are not restricted to):

*   Intelligent guidance for the creation, indexing and presentation
    of material stored in multimedia form (as in CD-I).

*   The development of techniques to handle presentation and dialogue
    involving arbitrary information in different media.

*   A focus on the interpretation (semantics) of different channels
    of communication, allowing display of the same information in
    different ways (often termed ``multimodality'').

*   The relationship between multimodal presentation and aspects of 
    users' tasks (e.g. reasoning, identification, etc.).

*   Formal methods for specification and reasoning in multimodal
    interactive systems.

*   A special theme on the integration of natural language and speech
    processing technology with interaction using other modalities
    such as graphics.

A followup Workshop is proposed, to be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in
late 1996, with the intention of further fostering transatlantic links.

Edinburgh, historic capital of Scotland, is one of the most attractive
of European cities.  This Workshop will be located in the majestic City
Chambers, less than five minutes' walk from the famous Castle.
University accommodation will be available very close to the venue.
Edinburgh in summer is invariably host to a wide range of events and
activities, which in 1995 includes for instance the spectacular Tall
Ships Race, due to begin immediately following the Workshop.

Abstracts of approximately 5 pages in length should be submitted
by 14th February 1995 (preferably in electronic form) to:

John Lee
Human Communication Research Centre
University of Edinburgh
2 Buccleuch Place
Edinburgh EH8 9LW
Scotland, UK.

Email:	J.Lee@ed.ac.uk
Tel:   +44 131 650 4420
Fax:   +44 131 650 4587

Requests for further information, registration forms, bookings for
accommodation etc. should be directed to the same address.

A notice of intention to submit an abstract would be appreciated as
early as possible, preferably by 30th November 1994.

Abstracts will be refereed: participation is limited to promote
discussion.  Accepted abstracts will be published in the quarterly of
the IISIG (IIQ: ISSN 1356-3262) and it is intended that selected authors
will be invited to expand their contributions into full-length papers to
be published in book form.

Local Organisation:  Paul  Mc Kevitt (University of Sheffield)

The past few years have seen  an  increasing  tendency  for 
diversification  in
research into Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and
Artificial Life.  A
number of approaches are being pursued, based variously on  symbolic 
reasoning,
connectionist  systems  and  models,  behaviour-based  systems,  and 
ideas from
complex  dynamical  systems.   Each  has  its   own   particular  
insight   and
philosophical position.

This variety of approaches appears in  all  areas  of  Artificial 
Intelligence.
There  are  both  sybmolic  and  connectionist natural language
processing, both
classical and behaviour-based vision research, for instance.

While purists from each approach may claim that all the  problems  of
 cognition
can  in principle be tackled without recourse to other methods, in
practice (and
maybe in theory, also) combinations of methods  from  the  different 
approaches
(hybrid  methods)  are more successful than a pure approach for
certain kinds of
problems.  The committee feels that there is an unrealised synergy 
between  the
various approaches that an AISB conference may be able to explore.

Thus, the focus of the tenth AISB Conference is  on  such  hybrid 
methods.   We
particularly  seek  papers  that  describe novel theoretical and/or
experimental
work which uses a hybrid approach or papers from purists, arguing
cogently  that
compromise  is  unnecessary  or  unproductive.   While  papers such
as those are
particularly sought, good papers on any topic in Artificial
Intelligence will be
considered:   as  always,  the  most  important  criteria for
acceptance will be
soundness, originality, substance and clarity.  Research in all areas
is equally
welcome.

The AISB conference is a single track conference lasting three days,
with a  two
day  tutorial  and  workshop  programme  preceding the main technical
event, and
around twenty high calibre papers will be presented in the  technical
 sessions.
It  is expected that the proceedings of the conference will be
published in book
form in time to be available at the conference itself, making  it  a 
forum  for
rapid dissemination of research results.


SUBMISSIONS:

High quality original papers dealing with the issues raised by mixing
 different
approaches,  or otherwise related to the Conference Theme, should be
sent to the
Programme Chair.  Papers  which  give  comparative  experimental 
evaluation  of
methods  from  different  paradigms  applied  to  the same problem,
papers which
propose and evaluate mixed-paradigm theoretical models or tools, and
papers that
focus  on  hybrid  systems  applied  to real world problems will be
particularly
welcome, as will papers from purists who argue cogently that the
hybrid approach
is flawed and a particular pure approach is to be preferred.

Papers being submitted, whether verbatim or in  essence,  to  other 
conferences
whose review process runs concurrently with AISB-95 should indicate
this fact on
their title page.  If a submitted paper appears at another conference
it must be
withdrawn  from  AISB-95  (this  does  not  apply  to presentation at
specialist
workshops).  Papers that violate these  requirements  may  be 
rejected  without
review.


SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield is one of the friendliest cities in the UK and is situated
well having
the  best  and  closest surrounding countryside of any major city in
the UK. The
Peak District National Park is only minutes away. It is a good city
for walkers,
runners,  and  climbers.   It  has  two  theatres,  the Crucible and
Lyceum. The
Lyceum, a beautiful Victorian theatre, has recently been renovated.  
Also,  the
city  has  three 10 screen cinemas.  There is a library theatre which
shows more
artistic films. The city has a large number of museums many of which
demonstrate
Sheffield's  industrial  past,  and there are a number of Galleries
in the City,
including the Mapping Gallery and Ruskin.  A number of important
ancient  houses
are close to Sheffield such as Chatsworth House. The Peak District
National Park
is a beautiful site for visiting and rambling upon.  There  are 
large  shopping
areas  in the City and by 1995 Sheffield will be served by a
'supertram' system:
the line to the Meadowhall shopping and leisure complex is already open.

The University of Sheffield's Halls of Residence are  situated  on 
the  western
side of the city in a leafy residential area described by John
Betjeman as ``the
prettiest suburb in England''.  Halifax Hall is centred on a local
Steel Baron's
house,  dating back to 1830 and set in extensive grounds. It was
acquired by the
University in 1830 and converted into a Hall of Residence  for  women
 with  the
addition of a new wing.


ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield Computer Science  Department  has  a  strong  programme  in
 Cognitive
Systems  and  is  part  of  the  University's Institute for Language,
Speech and
Hearing (ILASH).  ILASH has its own machines and  support  staff, 
and  academic
staff  attached to it from nine departments. Sheffield Psychology
Department has
the Artificial Intelligence Vision Research Unit (AIVRU) which  was 
founded  in
1984 to coordinate a large industry/university Alvey research
consortium working
on the development of computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles
and  robot
workstations.


FORMAT AND DEADLINES:

Four copies of submitted papers must be received by the Programme
Chair no later
than  24  OCTOBER  1994  to be considered.  Papers should be at most
12 pages in
length and be produced in 12 point, with at most 60 lines of text 
per  A4  page
and  margins  at  least  1 inch (2.5cm) wide on all sides (default
LaTeX article
style is OK).  They should include a cover sheet (not counted  in 
the  12  page
limit) giving the paper title, the abstract, the authors and their
affiliations,
including a contact address for both electronic and paper mail for
the principal
author.   Papers  should  be submitted in hard-copy, not
electronically.  Papers
that do not adhere to this format specification may be rejected
without review.

Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by 7 DECEMBER 1994
 and  full
camera-ready  copy  will  be  due  in  early JANUARY 1995
(publishers' deadlines
permitting).

Subject: CFP: 5th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation
Date: Friday, 7 October 1994 12:43PM

			   CALL FOR PAPERS

	 5th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation

			    20-23 May 1995
		       Leiden, The Netherlands

This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in Natural
Language Generation from such different perspectives as linguistics,
artificial intelligence, psychology, and engineering.  The meeting
continues the tradition of a series of workshops held biannually in
Europe (Royaumont, 1987; Edinburgh, 1989; Judenstein, 1991 and Pisa,
1993) but open to researchers from all over the world.

			      Programme
			      ---------

The Programme Committee consists of: Koenraad de Smedt (Leiden
University; chair), Chris Mellish (University of Edinburgh) and Hajo
Novak (IBM Deutschland).

Papers, posters and demonstrations are invited on original and
substantial work related to the automatic generation of natural
language, including computer linguistics research, artificial
intelligence methods, computer models of human language processing,
empirical research, and the development and evaluation of applied
systems.  Contributions on all aspects of natural language generation
are welcome, but a special theme of this workshop will be 'human text
generation'.  Researchers studying human professional writing in
relation to automatic generation are especially encouraged to submit.

To encourage a workshop atmosphere while allowing a relatively large
number of people to participate, selected papers will be given large
time slots including ample discussion time; other papers will be
grouped for shorter presentations and mutual interaction, and there
will be sessions for posters and computer demonstrations.

			     Submissions
			     -----------

Researchers wishing to present a PAPER are requested to submit three
copies of an original unpublished article between 4000 and 8000 words
long (inclusive of references).  The first page should include the
title, the name(s) and complete address(es) of the author(s), a
short summary, and an exact word count.

Researchers wishing to present a POSTER are invited to submit three
copies of a reduced version of their poster on 4 normal pages that
together form an A2 size sheet.  Use a normal character size.  The
poster should include a title, the name(s) and complete address(es) of
the author(s).

Researchers wishing to demonstrate a computer PROGRAM are invited to
send a three copies of a short description of their program together
with some examples of input and output and hardware requirements.
Please include the name(s) and complete address(es) of the author(s)
in the description.

All contributions should be sent BEFORE 1 JANUARY 1995 to the
Programme Chairman at the following address:

		Dr. Koenraad De Smedt
		Leiden University
		Unit of Experimental and Theoretical Psychology
		P.O.Box  9555
		NL - 2300 RB  Leiden
		The Netherlands

E-mail: desmedt@ruls40.leidenuniv.nl       Tel: +31 71-273407

			  Local arrangements
			  ------------------

Local arrangements are handled by: Koenraad de Smedt and Gerard Kempen
(Leiden University).

The meeting will be held from the afternoon of Saturday May 20, 1995
through noon on Tuesday 23, in Castle Oud-Poelgeest in Leiden.  The
estate consists of a hotel, meeting rooms, restaurant, sauna, and a
seventeenth century castle with a bar, situated in a 25 acre park, 5
min. by taxi from the centre of Leiden.  The city of Leiden, where
Rembrandt was born, has the oldest university in The Netherlands.
Leiden is 15 min. by train from Amsterdam (Schiphol) airport.

The cost of the workshop to each participant is currently estimated at
about DFL 700 (Dutch guilders) including accommodation and meals, but
the participants' fee may turn out to be lower depending on funding.
The workshop will also be open to a limited number of participants not
contributing a paper, poster or demo.  A call for participation
including more information and a registration form will be sent out
later as soon as the programme has been put together.

N.B. The workshop is scheduled immediately before CMC/95 in Eindhoven.

Subject: CFP Linguistic Databases
Date: Monday, 17 October 1994 10:00AM



                 Call for Papers: Linguistic Databases
                           23-24 March 1995
                        University of Groningen
                       Groningen, The Netherlands

  A database is simply a declarative representation of information
which is designed to make data entry and retrieval easy, but is not
optimized for other processing.  Databases have long been standard
repositories in phonetic research, but they are finding increasing use
not only in phonology, morphology, syntax, historical linguistics and
dialectology but also in areas of applied linguistics such as
lexicography and computer-assisted language learning. Normally, they
serve as a repositories for large amounts of data, but they are also
important for the organization they impose, which serves to ease
access for researchers and applications specialists.
  The purpose of a workshop specifically on this topic to provide a
forum for the exchange of information and views on the proper use of
databases within the various subfields of linguistics.
  We hope to include papers addressing the following questions:

  1. Databases vs. annotated corpora, pros and cons.
  2. Needs wrt acoustic data, string data, temporal data. 
      Existing facilities.
  3. Developing (maximally) theory-neutral db schemas for annotation 
      systems.
  4. Commercially available systems vs. public domain systems. 
      What's available?
  5. Uses in grammar checking, replication of results.
  6. Needs of applications such as lexicography.
  7. Making use of CD-ROM technology.
  8. Existing professional expertise: Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), TEI.

Invited Speakers
   Jan Aarts, Prof. of English, Nijmegen, leader of TOSCA, 
    Linguistic Database:
   "Annotation of Corpora: General Issues and the Nijmegen Experience"

   Natalie Granger, Prof. of English, Louvain (tentative)
   "Corpora and Computer-Assisted Language Learning"

   Mark Liberman, Prof. of Linguistics & Computer Science, Pennsylvania; 
    Director, Ling. Data Consortium

Date: Thursday, 20 October 1994 8:24AM

            ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES
         ASSOCIATION FOR LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING
 
          1995 JOINT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE  ACH-ALLC 95
 
                          JULY 11-15, 1995
          UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA
 
 
                          CALL FOR PAPERS
 
This conference -- the major forum for literary, linguistic and
humanities computing-- will highlight the development of new
computing methodologies for research and teaching in the humanities,
the development of significant new computer-based resources for
humanities research, especially focusing on the issues and problems
of networked access to materials, and the developing applications,
evaluation, and use of traditional y scientific and computing
techniques in humanities disciplines.
 
 
TOPICS:  We welcome submissions on topics and applications focused
on the humanities disciplines, defined as broadly as possible:
languages and literature, history, philosophy, music, art,
linguistics, anthropology and archaeology, creative writing, and
cultural studies.  We are interested in receiving technical
proposals that focus on the cutting edge issues of the application
of scientific tools and approaches to humanities disciplines;
discipline-based proposals that focus on some of the more
traditionally defined applications of computing in humanities
disciplines, including text encoding, hypertext, text corpora,
computational lexicography, statistical models, and syntactic,
semantic, stylistic and other forms of text analysis; broad library
and research-based proposals that focus on significant issues of
text documentation and information retrieval; and tools-focused
proposals that offer innovative and substantial applications and
uses for humanities-based teaching and research, throughout the
academic and research worlds.
 
 
The deadline for submissions is 15 DECEMBER 1994.
 
 
REQUIREMENTS: Proposals should describe substantial and original
work. Those that concentrate on the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied
to research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include
some critical assessment of the application of those methodologies
in the humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular
application in the humanities (e.g., a study of the style of an
author) should cite traditional as well as computer-based
approaches to the problem and should include some critical
assessment of the computing methodologies used. All proposals
should include conclusions and references to important sources.
 
 
INDIVIDUAL PAPERS: Abstracts of 1500-2000 words should be submitted
for presentations of thirty minutes including questions.
 
 
SESSIONS: Proposals for sessions (90 minutes) are also invited.
These should take the form of either:
 
(a) Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word
statement describing the session topic, include abstracts of
1000-1500 words for each paper, and indicate that each author is
willing to participate in the session; or
 
(b) A panel of up to 6 speakers. The panel organizer should submit
an abstract of 1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will
be organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that
each speaker is willing to participate in the session.
 
 
POSTERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS
 
 
ACH-ALLC '95 will include poster presentations and software and
project demonstrations (either stand-alone or in conjunction with
poster presentations) to give researchers an opportunity to present
late-breaking results, significant work in progress, well-defined
problems, or research that is best communicated in conversational
mode.
 
By definition, poster presentations are less formal and more
interactive than a standard talk.  Poster presenters will have the
opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to
discuss their work in detail with those most deeply interested in
the same topic.  Posters are actually several large pieces of paper
that present an overview of a topic or a problem.  Poster presenters
are given space to display two or three posters, and may provide
handouts with examples or more detailed information.
 
Poster presenters must be present at their posters at a
specific time during the conference to describe their work and
answer questions, but posters will remain up throughout the
conference.  Specific times will also be assigned for software or
project demonstrations.  Further information on poster presentations
is available from the Program Committee chair.
 
Posters proposals and software and project demonstrations will be
accepted until February 15, 1995 to provide an opportunity for
submitting very current work that need not be written up in a full
paper.  Poster or software/project demonstration proposals should
contain a 300 to 500 word abstract in the same format described
below for paper proposals.  Proposals for software or project
demonstrations should indic ate the type of hardware that would be
required if the proposal is accepted.
 
Doctoral students are encouraged to consider poster submission as a
viable means for discussing ongoing dissertation research.

                      REVIEW OF PAPERS
                      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Submissions  will  be  judged  on  significance, originality,
quality  and  clarity.   Reviewing   will  be  blind  to  the
identities  of  the  authors.   This  requires  that  authors
exercise  some  care  not  to  identify  themselves  in their
papers.  Each  copy  of  the  paper  must  have a title page,
separated  from the body of the paper, including the title of
the paper,  the names and addresses of all authors, a list of
content areas (see above) and any acknowledgments. The second
page should include the same title,  a short abstract of less
than 200 words,  and the exact same  contents areas,  but not
the names nor affiliations of  the  authors.  This  page  may
include text of the paper.  The references should include all
published   literature   relevant  to  the  paper,  including
previous  works  of  the  authors,  but  should  not  include
unpublished works of the authors. When referring to one's own
work,  use  the  third  person. For example, say "previously,
Peter [17] has shown that ...".  Try  to  avoid including any
information in the body of the paper or references that would
identify the authors or their institutions.  Such information
can  be  added  to  the  final   camera-ready   version   for
publication.  Please do not staple the title page to the body
of the paper. Submitted papers must be unpublished.
 
 
                         PUBLICATION
                         %%%%%%%%%%%
The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag (lecture
notes in A.I. series).  Authors  will be required to transfer
copyright of their paper to Springer-Verlag.
 
 
                    ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS
                    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In  the  framework  of the conference three workshops will be
organized:  Applications of Expert  Systems,  Fuzzy Logic and
Neural  Networks   in   Engineering,   and   Applications  of
Artificial Intelligence to Robotics and Vision Systems.  Real
world applications, running systems, and demos are welcome.

       * First Workshop on Applications of NATURAL LANGUAGE to DATA BASES *
 
                       Versailles, France, JUNE 28-29 1995

                       ________________________________
 
This workshop aims at bringing together researchers, potential industrial
and users, interested in various applications of natural language in the
database field.  The integration of databases and natural language has been
for a long time an utopia.  Since two decades, consulting databases or
getting answers in natural language remain a dream for many users. This is
nowadays an accessible convergent point for which a lot of researchers are
focusing on.  It is mainly due to the large progress of research in natural
language and to the development of new technologies which allow the storage
of real semantic electronic dictionaries.  Each aspect of the life cycle of
the information system may be improved by using natural language
techniques : database design (specification, validation, conflicts
resolution), database query languages and consulting programs that use new
software engineering research allowing natural language program
specifications.
 
TOPICS:  Major Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the
following:
 - Natural languages interfaces for database querying,
 - Natural language as a specification interface for database design,
 - Paraphrasing of database design conceptual schema  in natural language,
 - Linguistic aspects of view integration,
 - Conceptual modelling and linguistic knowledge,

PACLING '95
Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics 
2nd Conference

April 19-22 (Wed-Sat) 1995 
The University of Queensland 
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia



********************
* HISTORY AND AIMS *
********************

PACLING (= Pacific Association for Computational 
LINGuistics) has grown out of the very successful Japan-
Australia joint symposia on natural language processing 
(NLP) held in November 1989 in Melbourne, Australia and in 
October 1991 in Iizuka City, Japan. The first meeting of 
the retitled PACLING, a name designed to express the wider 
membership, took place in Vancouver, Canada in April 1993.

PACLING '95 will be a low-profile, high-quality, workshop-
oriented meeting whose aim is to promote friendly 
scientific relations among Pacific Rim countries, with 
emphasis on interdisciplinary scientific exchange showing 
openness towards good research falling outside current 
dominant "schools of thought," and on technological 
transfer within the Pacific region. The conference is a 
unique forum for scientific and technological exchange, 
being smaller than ACL, COLING or Applied NLP, and also 
more regional with extensive representation from the 
Western Pacific (as well as the Eastern).

**********
* TOPICS *
**********

        ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS - AusWeb95 - AUSTRALIA, April 1995
        ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS - AusWeb95 - AUSTRALIA, April 1995

Ballina Beach Resort, Ballina, Far North Coast of New South Wales, Australia.
                           29 April to 2 May 1995

A QUICK OVERVIEW

Southern Cross University hosts AusWeb95 at the Ballina Beach Resort in
Ballina on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, Australia from 29 April
to 2 May 1995. AusWeb95 is the first Australian conference on the
WorldWideWeb.

The conference has been designed to bring together those that are interested
in the content, technical and societal aspects of the Web. Because the Web
is so new and evolving so rapidly, we are all "beginners" and can (and must)
learn from each other.

The conference will cover the major issues in WorldWideWeb development
in ten "tracks" and a poster and "Birds of a Feather" session. It will feature
both Australian and international speakers. The proceedings of AusWeb95
will be published in both electronic and print formats. There will also be a
competition for "the most interesting Web site in the World".

Full details on AusWeb95 can be seen at
          http://www.scu.edu.au/ausweb95/index.html
or by emailing the organisers at mailto:AusWeb95@scu.edu.au

WHERE IS IT BEING HELD?

Ballina is a seaside, tourist town on the Far North Coast of New South
Wales, Australia with excellent connections by air to Sydney and by road
from Coolangatta.It is only 20 minutes drive from Byron Bay which is one of
the most sought after tourist areas in Australia and an hour to the World
Heritage listed rain forest of the Nightcaps National Park. The Ballina Beach
resort is 50 metres from Ballina's excellent surfing Lighthouse
Beach. In April
you can still comfortably swim in the sea but there is also the Resort's pool,
spa and sauna, not to mention the tennis courts. The AusWeb95 home page has
pictures of the resort, the beach and of Byron Bay.

The Lismore campus of Southern Cross University is 28km inland from Ballina.

PRECONFERENCE TRAINING WORKSHOP

A "hands on" Preconference Training Workshop will be held at the University on
Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 April. The workshop is designed for those who
have heard about the Web and wish to learn about this important resource.
No WWW, or for that matter Internet, experience is assumed. Participants
will learn how to author WorldWideWeb materials and how to bring a server
to the net. The workshop will be very much hands on and will use training
materials which have been developed for staff at Southern Cross University.
The workshop will conclude with each participant developing material which
will incorporate text, graphics, video and sound.

There will be a limit of 20 people in the training workshop with each
participant having their own computer.

For further details, email the conference organisers at
mailto:AusWeb95@scu.edu.au
or call Allan Ellis (+61 66 20 3611) or Roger Debreceny (+61 66 20 3837).

WHAT IS THE CONFERENCE FORMAT?

AusWeb95 has been designed to maximise the interaction between the
participants and to facilitate the sharing of experiences and to foster co-
operative project and content development. There are a total of ten
simultaneous sessions on the programs which will be designated as tracks.
As all papers will be available well ahead of the conference there is no need
for lengthy formal presentations. For each track there will be a moderator
who will be asked to draw the threads from each of the presentations on that
track. Paper contributors will then be able to make some opening comments
before the issues are thrown open to general discussion amongst the
participants.

WHAT IS THE CONFERENCE PROGRAM?

The program, which will be amended as necessary following
feedback from participants, is as follows:

Friday 28 April

WHAT ARE THE THEMES OF THE CONFERENCE?

The themes from the conference will be drawn from the expressed interests of
the participants. Listed below and on the registration form are a total of 21
tracks - clearly 21 tracks into 10 simultaneous sessions do not go! And it is
very likely that there will need to be more than one track on education. So
some of these tracks may well be put together, and others will be covered in
the poster and Birds of a Feather session. The final tracks will be decided
after 3 February 1995.

Welcome to Trondheim !
----------------------

Trondheim is the third largest city and the technical capital of
Norway. Trondheim was already a center of power in Norway in 997, when
the Viking king Olav Tryggvason founded a trading town at the mouth of
the Nid river and built a castle there.  Trondheim became Norway's
first capital.

Modern Trondheim features culture, research and education, besides
trade and industry. The Norwegian Institute of Technology (abbreviated
in Norwegian: NTH) was established here in 1910 and is the only
technical university in the country. A major technological environment
has grown up around it, larger than any other technological center in
Norway. The other major part of the University is the College of Arts
and Science (AVH), which has grown from a rather small college 25
years ago, to its present size equal to NTH. With its 16000 students,
the University of Trondheim is the second largest in Norway. Close to
the University there is Scandinavia's largest foundation for
scientific and industrial research - SINTEF - with 2200 employees
performing contract research and development for industry and public
sector.

Take the opportunity to participate in both technical and cultural
events during SCAI'95. We look forward to seeing you in Trondheim!

> 
> Submission must be identified as one of three different categories: vision,

challenges,
> ideas, or visoins that lead to exciting and valuable CIS research
directions.
> Vison papers will be evaluated with respect to innovation, realizable
> applications and technologies, and technical challenges posed
(e.g., that do 
> not currently admit of solutions). Research papers should advance the state
> of the art of CIS and will be evaluated using conventional
scientific criteria.
> Experience papers should describe the practical applications of CIS
concepts or
> methods. They will be evaluated in terms of lessons learned,
research issues 
> raised, and solutions to realistic challenges, such as those of legacy
> information systems.
>   
> 
> Five copies of original and compelling unpublished papers up to 6000 words 
> that are not under consideration for publication elsewhere during
the reviewing
> period should be sent to the appropriate Programme Committee Co-Chair.
> Submissions must include contact information (contact name, postal
and e-mail

Subject: Call for Papers - ACL-95 Corpus Workshop
Date: Wednesday, 30 November 1994 4:55PM



ACL's SIGDAT presents the

   THIRD WORKSHOP ON VERY LARGE CORPORA

Preliminary Call for Papers


WHEN:    June 30, 1995 - immediately following ACL-95 (June 27-29)
WHERE:   MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA


WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:

As in past years, the workshop will offer a general forum for new research in
corpus-based and statistical natural language processing.  Areas of interest
include (but are not limited to): sense disambiguation,
part-of-speech tagging,
robust parsing, term and name identification, alignment of parallel text,
machine translation, lexicography, spelling correction, morphological analysis
and anaphora resolution.

This year, the workshop will be organized around the theme of:

        Supervised Training vs. Self-organizing Methods

Is annotation worth the effort?  Historically, annotated corpora have
made a significant contribution.  The tagged Brown Corpus, for example,
led to important improvements in part-of-speech tagging.  But annotated
corpora are expensive.  Very little annotated data is currently available,
especially for languages other than English.  Self-organizing methods offer
the hope that annotated corpora might not be necessary.  Do these methods
really work?  Do we have to choose between annotated corpora and
unannotated corpora?  Can we use both?

The workshop will encourage contributions of innovative research along this
spectrum.  In particular, it will seek work in languages other than English
and in applications where appropriately tagged training corpora do not exist.
It will also explore what new kinds of corpus annotations (such as discourse
structure, co-reference and sense tagging) would be useful to the community,
and will encourage papers on their development and use in experimental
projects.

The theme will provide an organizing structure to the workshop, and
offer a focus for debate.  However, we expect and will welcome a diverse
set of submissions in all areas of statistical and corpus-based NLP.


PROGRAM CHAIRS:

    Ken Church      - AT&T Bell Laboratories
    David Yarowsky  - University of Pennsylvania


SPONSOR:   SIGDAT (ACL's special interest group for linguistic data
                         and corpus-based approaches to NLP)


FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION:   Authors should submit a full-length paper
(3500-8000 words), either electronically or in hard-copy. Electronic
submissions must either be plain ascii text or a single latex file
following the ACL-95 stylesheet (no separate figures or .bib files).
Hard copy submissions should include four (4) copies of the paper.
Authors should consult the primary call for papers in late January for
updated specifications.

                      Call for Participation
 
           11th Intl. IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
           *********************************************
 
  Tutorials Sept. 5 - 6, 1995  ----  Paper sessions Sept. 6 - 9, 1995
 
                  University at Darmstadt, Germany
 
General Chairs:   Allen L. Ambler, University of Kansas, USA
                  Takayuki Dan Kimura, Washington Univ. St. Louis, USA
 
Programme Chair:  Hans-Juergen Hoffmann, Univ. at Darmstadt, Germany
 
 
The Symposium continues the previous annual workshops and symposia on
          Visual Languages 1984, 1986, 1987, ... 1993, 1994.
The focus of the symposium series is an interest in multi-dimensional,
multi-sensorial man-machine communication, particularly when such com-
munication is for the purpose of defining tasks, whether in the sense
of programming or querying or operating. The means of achieving such
definition of tasks can include text description, visual manipulation,
visual image recognition, handwriting recognition, voice recognition,
physical gestures and other technologies. While, historically, visual
technologies have dominated the Symposium on Visual Languages, we
would like to encourage submissions employing other multi-dimensional or
multi-sensorial technologies, particularly when combined with visual
technologies.
 
For 1995 the following list of topics gives ideas of emphasis:
 
     Visual, iconic, and multimodal languages for programming and
            querying,
     Visual languages "in-the-large",
     Application domains
       - Visual languages and geographic information systems (GIS),
       - Visual languages and architecture / design,
       - Diagrammatical reasoning / spatial reasoning,
       - Visual languages for end-user programming,
       - Visual languages in groupware applications,
       - Visual languages to support tele-communication,
       - ...       (you invent them, let's talk about!),
     Iconic languages,
     Foundations of visual languages,
     Metalevel modelling of visual languages,
     Tools for specification of and reasoning about languages of the
            kind considered,
     Application of intelligence to enhance language communication,
            including logical deduction to interpret visual, iconic,
            and multimodal interactions,
     Empirical studies and evaluations, usability studies,
            reports on applications,
     Multimodal interaction techniques (3D, voice, pen-based, eye tracking,
            ...) in visual environments,
     Integration of visual approaches with multimedia,
     Animation,
     Implementation issues,
     Environments for visual, iconic, and multimodal operations,
            editing, visualization, animation etc.

Subject: CFP: IJCAI-95 Workshop on Computational Auditory Scene Analysis
Date: Wednesday, 21 December 1994 7:17PM

                         Call For Papers

                     IJCAI-95 Workshop on
               Computational Auditory Scene Analysis

                 August 19-20, 1995, Montreal, CANADA
                       Two day workshop


The interest of AI in problems related to understanding sounds has a
rich history dating back to the ARPA Speech Understanding Project in
the 1970's.  While a great deal has been learned from this and
subsequent speech understanding research, the goal of building systems
that can understand general acoustic signals (e.g. continuous speech
and/or non-speech sounds) from unconstrained environments is still
unrealized.  Instead, there are now systems that understand "clean"
speech well in relatively noiseless laboratory environments, but that
break down in more realistic, noisier environments.  As seen in the
"cocktail-party effect," humans (and other mammals) have the ability
to selectively attend to sound from a particular source, even when it
is mixed with other sounds.  Computers also need to be able to decide
which parts of a mixed acoustic signal are relevant to a particular
purpose -- which part should be interpreted as speech, for example,
and which should be interpreted as a door closing, an air conditioner
humming, or another person interrupting.

Observations such as these have led a number of researchers to
conclude that research on speech understanding and on non-speech
understanding need to be united within a more general framework.  One
such framework is suggested by the Bregman's recent book, "Auditory
Scene Analysis" (MIT Press, '90).  This work has inspired a number of
systems that attempt to model what is known about the human auditory
system.  It has also encouraged researchers to explore general models
of the structure of sounds in order to deal with more realistic
acoustic environments.  Researchers have also begun trying to
understand computational auditory frameworks as parts of larger
perception systems whose purpose is to give a computer integrated
information about the real world.  Inspiration for this work ranges
from research on how different sensors can be integrated to models of
how humans' auditory apparatus works in concert with vision,
proprioception, etc.

This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to compare
approaches to AI-oriented auditory scene analysis.  We invite papers
from researchers active in all fields which have a bearing on this
complex and diverse field.  The topics include, but are not limited to:

- Modeling Issues:
	Cognitive Modeling
	Low-level Auditory Models
	Evaluation of Auditory models from viewpoint of engineering

- Sound Understanding:
	Auditory Stream Segregation
	Multi-Modal Understanding (i.e. integration with other perceptual
	systems)
	Engineering Aspects of Psychoacoustics

-Architectural Issues:
	Unified Architectures
	Blackboard Architectures
	Multi-Agent Paradigm
	Hybrid Approach to Top-Down/ Bottom-Up processing

- Control Issues:
	Reactive/ Planned Behavior
	Adaptive Behavior

- Representational Issues:
	Representation of Audition
	Representation of Speech
	Representation of Music
	Unified Representation of (possibly Dynamic) Vision and Audition

- Applications:
	Speech Understanding
	Music Understanding
	Multi-Modal Integration

Introduction
============

A considerable potential  market  exists for  robust systems which 
can perform
free text information  retrieval, machine assisted  translation,
summarisation,
routing and related tasks on pre-existing documents.  An important
component in
many systems of this  kind is a parser which  will allow grammatical
(and hence
semantic) relations between textual units to be determined.

There is a large literature on parsing but only recently has much
emphasis been
placed upon robust coverage of  real texts rather than  the fragile
analysis of
simple  example sentences. Competitions such   as the Text Retrieval
Conference
(TREC) and the Message Understanding   Conference (MUC) have provided
a  useful
focus  on practical considerations   by  concentrating on the
optimisation   of
overall  system  performance  in  a  specific task   which  is  
shared by  all
participants. Our aim  is to concentrate on   parsing alone and to
undertake  a
more detailed comparison of approaches.

Discussion and experimentation will revolve around our chosen text
domain - the
instruction manuals shipped  with  computer software  for  the PC.
This  is  an
important   area   because there  is   an   increasing convergence 
between the
development of accompanying documentation and the provision of
on-line help. In
addition  there  is   a need  to  automate   the   complex  process
of  product
localisation.  One aspect of this process is  the semi-automatic
translation of
accompanying documents into the language of each target market, a
task which is
greatly  facilitated   if  an accurate  syntactic  analysis    of the
 texts is
available.

It  is not our  intention to compare the   literal characteristics of
different
parsing algorithms as this  topic is very well covered  already.
Rather we wish
to  investigate the efficacy of competing  parsing *systems*, each
comprising a
parser  and grammar taken together. What  exactly are the
difficulties faced in
trying  to analyse utterances derived  from the  domain of
instruction manuals,
and what are the strengths and  weaknesses of the  various parsing
methods when
applied to it? The following general issues are of interest:

* How easy is it to develop a grammar for the parser?

* What existing resources exist for the parser and how easy are they to modify
  for new purposes?

* What type of data structures are returned by the parser?

* What information do these data structures structures contain and how easy is
  it to extract that information?


Organisation of Workshop
========================

Early in 1995, each participating group will be supplied  with a
technical text
in machine readable  form together with a  list of the terminology
occurring in
that text. The document will be in American English. The  group will
then spend
some time working on the development of their parser/grammar to
ensure coverage
of  utterances  within  the text.   The  next  stage will   be
analysis of  the
resulting parse trees with  a view to establishing  the efficacy of
the parsing
system with respect to the following kinds of issues:

* The resolution of prepositional phrase attachment - how accurately can this
  be accomplished in this domain?

* The analysis of and/or/comma coordination - what characteristics do such
  coordinations have in this domain and what techniques can be used to analyse
  them accurately?

* The handling of gapping and other forms of ellipsis - to what extent is the
  best approach to this problem dependent on the parsing system being used?

* Efficiency - how long does it take to analyse the sentences and what space
  requirements are entailed?

Finally,  participants will meet  in Limerick in  May to compare
results and to
discuss their  implications. Proceedings of the  workshop will be
produced as a
UL Technical Report and it is planned to publish this after the meeting.


Participation
=============

The following have already agreed to take part in the workshop:

University College Dublin, Ireland
University of Heidelberg, Germany
University of Limerick, Ireland
University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands
University of Pennsylvania, USA


Proposals for participation are welcomed  by  other groups. Please
contact  the
organisers for more information.

The above groups all use systems consisting of  a parser together
with either a
grammar or a syntagmatic  lexicon. However  we  are happy to include 
teams who
work with statistical or connectionist methods.


Natural Language Processing at UL
=================================

The NLP  group  at Limerick  has   interests  in computational 
lexicology  and
lexicography,  computer  assisted  language  learning,   information
retrieval,
machine assisted  translation, software  localisation, syntagmatic
parsing  and
word sense disambiguation.

The group has received  sponsorship from a number   of sources
including  Apple
Computer, the European   Union,  EOLAS, the  Industrial Development 
Board  for
Northern Ireland, K &  M,   Microsoft, the  National Software
Directorate   and
Siemens.

Previous conferences    organised at UL    include  Artificial
Intelligence and
Cognitive Science  1992, Eagna  chun  Gnimh (Irish Computational 
Linguistics),
Natural Language    Processing   in  Ireland  1992  (NLPI'92),    
NLPI'93, and
International Workshop on Machine Translation 1994.


About the University of Limerick
================================

The University of Limerick is situated on rolling  parkland beside
the historic
River  Shannon.   The tranquil  red brick    campus is  complemented 
by lakes,
fountains and sculptures.

The workshop will be based in the Robert Schuman Building, home of
the Computer
Science and Information  Systems Department,  an  airy  and majestic 
structure
incorporating  lecture  theatres.   meeting rooms,   computer 
laboratories and
research centres, all equipped to the highest standards.

The Shannon Region is especially beautiful in  early summer, and
there are many
sights worth visiting: Bunratty Castle, the thousand foot high Cliffs
of Moher,
Rock of Cashel,  King John's Castle, and  Aillwee  Caves are  all
close  by. In
addition  there is Loch  Derg,  teeming with wildlife  on  its many
islands and
surrounded by blue-green hills and lofty mountains.

The University is easily reached -  Shannon International Airport is
only 20kms
away, with regular direct flights to London, New York, and many other cities.

We encourage discussions of experimental studies, tests of usability,
explorations of information-retrieval behavior, reports on large scale
system performance, and demonstrations of advanced approaches.  We prefer
that: contributions that discuss theory, have sufficient motivation and
proof of utility; that designs have been proven by a prototype; that
reports on small-scale experiments include convincing arguments or
simulations to show their likelihood to generalize; and that writing is
carefully copy edited and well organized. 

All papers shall provide a concise message to the audience about how the
work relates to previous research or experience, what aspects of the work
are new, and the "lessons learned."  Papers will be evaluated on the basis
of originality, significance of the contribution to the field, quality of
research, and quality of writing. 

Papers shall be submitted in English to the relevant Program Co-chair. 
Specific submission requirements: 

(a)  Papers shall be submitted in four copies.

(b)  Papers must include an abstract of not more than 100 words.

(c) Papers must be 20 pages or less (double spaced), including abstract,
	figures,and references.  Final versions of accepted papers may
	require further trimming to meet publication standards.

(d)  Authors shall provide a separate cover page (not included in the length 
	limitations) with the title, the author name(s), and the author
	affiliation(s), plus complete contact information (mailing address, 
	telephone, fax, and e-mail) for the author to whom correspondence
	should be send. 

(e)  Show the word count for the paper on the cover page.

(f) Indicate if the paper is to be considered for the Best Student Paper
	Award. This Award requires that the first and primary author be a
	full-time student at time of submission.


				TUTORIALS 

SIGIR'95 will begin with a full day of tutorials, each of which is
intended to cover a single topic in detail.  Proposals are solicited from
people willing to give tutorials. Tutorials may be either a half day (4
hours) or full day in length and can cover topics at an introductory or
advanced level. Submissions shall be made to the Tutorials and Panels
Chair and shall consist of : 

  (a) An extended abstract outlining the exact content of the tutorial.
	This should be approximately 3 to 5 pages in length. Sample slides
	also would be helpful. 
  
  (b) Tutorial Length: half-day or full day. 

  (c) A description of the intended audience outlining what attendees are
	expected to know,  the technical level of the tutorial and the 
	objectives of the tutorial. 

  (d) A CV for each presenter detailing relevant qualifications and
	experience. Some biographical details may also be helpful. 
  
  (e)  A complete description of A/V and computer equipment required for the 
	tutorial. 
 
  (f)  Complete address for the presenter(s), including phone, fax and e-mail 
	addresses. 

E-mail submissions shall be in plain ascii text.
 

				   PANELS

SIGIR'95 will include a small number of panel sessions. These are intended
to examine issues of interest to the research and development community
and stimulate lively debate between panelists and audience members. 
Presentations by panel members should lay the groundwork and open the
debate. Ideally the panel shall consist of 4 members, with very divergent
views on the topic. The moderator shall referee the debate, ensuring a
good balance in the discussion without presenting a position.  Proposals
are solicited from moderators and/or panelists.  Submissions shall be made
to the Tutorials and Panels Chair and shall consist of: 

(a) An extended abstract outlining the proposed topic, including the
questions 
	likely to arise.  

(b)   A list of panel members and the name of a  moderator. 

(c) A CV for each panelist and the moderator, detailing relevant
	qualifications and experience.  Some biographical details may also be 
	helpful.

(e)  Complete addresses for the moderator and panelists, including phone, fax
	and e-mail addresses.

E-mail submissions shall be in plain ascii text.


			    DEMONSTRATIONS

Demonstrations provide an opportunity for first-hand, interactive
experience with information retrieval systems.  Researchers and developers
have the opportunity to present their new systems, and conference
participants have the opportunity to interact directly with creators of
the systems demonstrated. 

We invite proposals for demonstrations of information retrieval systems
and applications.  Demonstrations should focus on aspects of the system
that are novel and important. Demonstrations are not limited to
experimental systems only. IR researchers participating in the NIST/ARPA
sponsored TREC, MUC, TIPSTER projects and the European Community research
initiatives are encouraged to participate. 

Presenters of the systems must be individuals who have been directly
involved with the development of the system, and who are aware of the
differentiating and interesting ideas embodied in their system.  All
presenters are expected to register for the conference. 

Presenters shall submit a proposal of at most three pages, describing the
planned demonstration, to the Demonstration Chair.  The proposal shall
include: 

(a) A description of noteworthy and distinguishing ideas or approaches the 
	demonstration will illustrate.

(b) An explanation of how the demonstration will illustrate these ideas or    
	approaches.

(c) Complete contact information (mailing address, telephone, fax, and
	e-mail) and affiliation of the person(s) who will present the 
	demonstration, including their relationship to the project (e.g.,
	principal investigator, developer, project manager, architect).

(d) A 100-word summary for inclusion in the conference's preliminary program.

(e) A description of the technical specifications of the system.  The
selected 
	presenters shall provide a description that is modeled after the TREC 
	technical specification descriptions.  An electronic form will be
	available via e-mail.

(f) A bibliography of published and unpublished materials that relate to the 
	system, its algorithms and underlying theories as well as any
	evaluations that have been undertaken.

(g) The hardware, software, and network requirements for the demonstration, 
	including the electrical requirements of the equipment.

No fax submissions; e-mail submissions preferred.


				POSTERS

SIGIR '95 will include poster presentations to enable researchers an
opportunity to present late-breaking results, significant work in
progress, or research that is best communicated in conversational mode.
Poster presenters will have the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one
with attendees and to discuss their work in detail with those most deeply
interested in the same topic. 

Posters will be reviewed by appropriate subject specialists as well as the
Program Committee, and will be selected on the basis of their contribution
to research- focused discussion. Posters will be accepted a full month
later than papers in order to provide an opportunity for submitting very
current work that need not be written up in a full paper. 

Abstracts of posters will appear in the conference proceedings.  There
will be a specific time during the conference when authors will be
expected to be present at their posters to describe their work and answer
questions, but posters will also be accessible for informal viewing
throughout the day. 

Doctoral students are encouraged to consider poster submission as a viable
means for discussing ongoing dissertation research. 

Submissions shall be made to the Posters Chair and shall consist of:

(a) Abstract, submitted in three copies.

(b) An extended abstract of approximately three to four pages.

(c) Abstract shall emphasize the research problem, the approach or
methodology 
	being used, and why the work is important.

(d) A separate cover page with the title of the poster, the name and
	affiliation of the author(s)/presenter(s), as well as
complete contact 
	information to include postal address, email address, phone number
	and fax number of the author(s).


				WORKSHOPS

Proposals are being solicited from both individuals and groups for one-day
workshops to be held on July 13.  Workshops bring together researchers to
share information and discuss a topic that relates to their expertise. 
Submissions shall be made to the Workshops Chair and shall be limited to 3
pages.  They shall contain: 

(a)  The theme and goal of the workshop.

(b)  The planned activities.

(c) A CV for each organizer detailing relevant qualifications and
	experience (not included in the length limitations).  Some
biographical 
	details may also be helpful.

(d)  Maximum number of participants.

(e)  Process for selecting participants.

(f)  List of potential participants.

After the workshop, organizers will provide an article summarizing
the workshop 
for SIGIR Forum.

No fax submissions.

Subject: IDA-95: International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis
Date: Thursday, 12 January 1995 8:50PM


                Last CALL FOR PAPERS AND PANELS     
 
   International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA-95)
                   Baden-Baden,  Germany
                   17th-19th August 1995
 
 
 Objective
 ---------
 
 The gap between data generation and data comprehension is widening. 
 Efficient computational methods for analysing data effectively are 
 required  to  narrow  this  gap.   There  have  been  a variety of 
 computationally   intelligent   techniques  developed,  which  are 
 beginning to provide such capability. However, many questions need
 to be properly  addressed  before  these  techniques  can be  most 
 effectively employed to perform various data analysis tasks. It is
 the purpose of  IDA-95  to provide an  international forum for the
 discussion of these questions, some of which are listed below:
 
 
    a) How important is it to  understand the data  characteristics
       and to pre-process  data  accordingly  before using the data
       for  tasks   such  as   classification   and    forecasting?
       [Exploratory data analysis,  incompleteness and uncertainty,
       noise filters, outliers]
 
    b) With so many modern techniques, which technique should I use
       for  my  application?    [Bayesian  networks,  fuzzy  logic,
       decision trees, genetic algorithms, neural nets, statistical
       pattern recognition]
 
    c) What is the  impact of  modern  visualisation  techniques on
       data analysis?  [Computer graphics,  computational geometry, 
       image processing, user interface]
 
    d) What is the role of domain knowledge in data analysis?  Does
       it help analyse data more  effectively  or simply  introduce
       "biases" into the analysis procedure?
 
    e) How do we  evaluate  the  performance  of  intelligent  data
       analysis systems?  What should we do when "golden standards"
       do not exist?
 
    f) How can  one  integrate a  variety of  related techniques to
       develop the most effective system for a given application?
 
 
 Submissions
 -----------
 
 Participants who wish to present a paper are requested to submit a
 1000 word  extended  abstract  as soon as possible,  but not later
 than   February  1,  1995.  (E-mail  submissions  are  preferred.)
 Notification  of acceptance  will be sent to  authors by March 15,
 1995. Full camera-ready  papers,  not  exceeding  5  single-spaced
 pages, will be required by  May 1, 1995  for  publication  in  the 
 Symposium Proceedings. In addition to  paper  presentations, panel
 sessions on one or more of the above-mentioned topics are planned. 
 If you would like to organise a panel discussion in these or other
 related  topics,  please  submit  your  proposals  with a one-page
 description of the subject matter and a list of proposed panelists
 by April 1, 1995.

              LANGUAGE ENGINEERING CONVENTION 1995


                       FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
          and CALL FOR PAPERS and TECHNICAL EXHIBITORS


The 1995 Language Engineering Convention and Exhibition will take 
place at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London on 16
- 18 October 1995. It is being organised by the Department of
Trade and Industry and co-organised by the European Commission.


Aims of the Language Engineering Convention

The aims of the Convention will be to promote the transfer of
emerging and current technology in speech and language, to
stimulate the industrial take-up in order to provide competitive
advantage to European industry and commerce, and to increase the
possibilities for communication in European languages by
integrating new spoken and written language-processing tools.

The Convention will be of importance to IT people in tourism,
banking, financial services, publishing, the Press, Government
and the IT industry in general and anyone else interested in the
transfer and future exploitation of this new technology from the
research base to application.


Convention sessions

In addition to detailed technical presentations in parallel
sessions there will be a number of invited speakers who will give
overview papers on topics of general interest. There will also be
opportunities during the plenary sessions for general discussions
on issues of interest to all delegates.


Call for Papers

Offers of papers are invited from teams working on EC funded
projects, European National programmes and others and will follow
a theme of application and usability to provide a vision for the
future. Papers should follow one of two routes with a focus on
results from ongoing European projects and national programmes or
on areas covering social policy, scientific challenges etc based
around the five following clusters:

   1. Office Systems, translation, multilingual interfaces and
      software.

   2. Information and communication services and language aids
      for the handicapped.

   3. Language training, multimedia publishing and sectoral
      applications. 

   4. Language resources, tools and standards.

   5. Technical authoring, information management and
      terminology.

Additionally, the final day sessions will be devoted to position
papers, which will be the basis for general discussions. The
position papers will be based around:

   a) Social policy
   b) Scientific challenges
   c) Programme funding/resources
   d) CEC and Government directions
   e) Relationship between theory and technology
   f) Usability

The time allocated for the presentation of technical papers will
be 20 minutes plus five minutes for discussion. Those intending
to offer a paper should, in the first instance, submit five (5)
copies of a synopsis of not more than 300 words on or before 1st
March 1995 to Mrs Linda Prior, Department of Trade and Industry,
EED, 151 Buckingham Palace Road, London SWlW 9SS, 
fax 071 215 1966.

Each synopsis should include the main points of the paper and
indicate where the emphasis will be placed. It is most important
that each synopsis should indicate very clearly:

   i. the title of your paper;

Subject: SIGDOC 95 Call for Papers
Date: Tuesday, 17 January 1995 10:08AM

                       ACM 1995 SIGDOC CONFERENCE 

                           A CALL FOR PAPERS

                          EMERGING FROM CHAOS:  
             SOLUTIONS FOR THE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF OUR JOBS

                        October 2 - 4, 1995

          Hyatt Regency on the historic Savannah riverfront

                       Savannah, Georgia

SIGDOC 95 is a platform for us, as documentation specialists, to share 
the solutions we have implemented to meet the challenges we face in our 
jobs. As we grow in experience and expertise, the challenges become more 
complex. We are no longer asked to provide one piece of the project but 
the complete solution. 

*  Print or on-line? Now we must deliver information through interactive 
   software, graphics, hypertext, video, and sound running on multiple 
   platforms. 

*  On-line help? Now we have help systems that mix full-text searches, 
   performance enhancement, and on-line selective viewing. 

Many of these challenges are not solved by one project but by 
interdependent projects, involving multiple teams from various 
departments to provide the required skills. More collaboration is needed 
among documentation, development, and other departments to deliver the 
solutions. 

SIGDOC 95 wants to hear 

*  how you approached these challenges 

*  what were the factors on which you based your decisions 

*  what were the constraints (distance, media, technology) 

*  how the plan was developed, reviewed, and approved 

*  how you deployed your plan 

*  what mid-project changes you had to make to the plan 

*  what results you achieved

The aim of SIGDOC 95 is to showcase real-life solutions we can apply in 
our jobs. 

                  *****************************

       ************************ Call for Papers ***********************

                     INSTITUTE OF ACOUSTICS SPEECH GROUP 


                               One Day Meeting on 


     INTEGRATING SPEECH RECOGNITION & NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS

           Hosted by the Laboratory for Natural Language Engineering
                            University of Durham, UK 


The theme of this meeting is to explore  ways  in  which  research  into
speech  recognition  technology  and  natural language processing can be
integrated to produce spoken language understanding systems.

The US ARPA Spoken  Language  Systems  (SLS)  programme  encourages  the
integration  of  SR  and  NLP  systems  in  the  ATIS domain and the CSR
programme has had one or  two  word  recognition  systems  that  use  NL
techniques. The traditional approach is for an NL system to post-process
the n-best output of an SR system. How successful is this approach, what
are its limitations?

What is the future of speech recognition, especially with respect to the
handling of more  natural,  spontaneous,  speech?  Do  NL  systems  have
anything  to  offer,  perhaps  through  providing  summaries  instead of
verbatim recognition?

The meeting will take place in Durham on

                   Thursday, 23rd March, 1995

Prospective speakers should send a  short  abstract  of  their  talk  to
Russell  Collingham  (address  at the end of this message) NO LATER THAN
Friday 10th February 1995.

THEME AND TARGET GROUP

The second international Conference On Spatial Information Theory,
COSIT 95, will concentrate on theoretical aspects of space and spatial
information. It will deal with all aspects of "large scale" or "geographic"
space and the description of objects, processes or events in it. Spatial
information theory is the basis for the construction of Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), but also necessary for other uses of geographic
information and useful for information system design in general. The use of
GIS technology reveals a large number of interesting research questions
which require an interdisciplinary approach for their solution. COSIT will
bring together researchers from different disciplines, e.g.
- Geography
- Engineering
- Geodesy
- Computer Science
- Cognitive Sciences
- Environmental Psychology
- Artificial Intelligence
- Administration
- History
- Sociology

The conference organizers welcome all contributions on Spatial Information
Theory. An idea of the conference's orientation can be gained from the
proceedings of COSIT 93, published by Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in
Computer Science 716.

The following topics are indicative for the field of interest and do not
exclude other research areas:
- Cognitive structure of space
- Social and cultural organization of space
- Languages of spatial relations
- Structure of geographic information
- Time in geographic information
- Spatial and temporal reasoning
- Quality aspects of geographic information
- Treating incomplete or imprecise spatial data
- Spatial data integration
- Presentation of spatial information
- Cartographic generalization
- Computational geography
- Spatial analysis and modeling
- Simulation of processes in geographic space
- User interface design
- Design of generic elements for GIS interfaces
- Metaphors for GIS
- Virtual Reality
- Cooperative work with spatial information
- Administrative and legal processes in space


CONFERENCE PROGRAM

At the conference, results from recent research will be presented and
discussions about work in progress will take place. The conference
program will be determined by an international, interdisciplinary
scientific committee. Papers will be selected through a rigorous review of
full paper contributions and the proceedings will be printed by a major
publisher before the conference. Panels will discuss the relevance of
research questions and compare possible approaches. Before the conference,
Tutorials or Workshops introducing the topics of the conference will be
organized, lasting from half a day to two days. Topical Meetings ("birds of
a feather sessions") can be organized and proposals from convenors are
welcome at any time before or during the conference.


A NOTE ON THE SITE

The Fourth International Workshop on Parsing Technologies IWPT'95 
will take place this year on September 20 through 23 in the Czech
Republic in the heart of Europe. This workshop will continue the
tradition, established by IWPT'89 and IWPT'93, of taking place 
partly on the premises of a university and partly in a rather 
secluded conference resort. The first part of IWPT'95 will thus 
be held at Charles University in Prague; the workshop then moves 
to a conference resort (Grand Hotel Pupp) in the famous old bathing 
resort of Karlovy Vary, also known as Karlsbad.

Subject: ACL-95 Corpus-based NLP Workshop - Call for Papers
Date: Wednesday, 15 February 1995 12:05PM


                    *** PRIMARY CALL FOR PAPERS ****

ACL's SIGDAT and SIGNLL present the

   THIRD WORKSHOP ON VERY LARGE CORPORA


WHEN:    June 30, 1995 - immediately following ACL-95 (June 27-29)
WHERE:   MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA


WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:

As in past years, the workshop will offer a general forum for new research in
corpus-based and statistical natural language processing.  Areas of interest
include (but are not limited to): sense disambiguation,
part-of-speech tagging,
robust parsing, term and name identification, alignment of parallel text,
machine translation, lexicography, spelling correction, morphological analysis
and anaphora resolution.

This year, the workshop will be organized around the theme of:

        Supervised Training vs. Self-organizing Methods

Is annotation worth the effort?  Historically, annotated corpora have
made a significant contribution.  The tagged Brown Corpus, for example,
led to important improvements in part-of-speech tagging.  But annotated
corpora are expensive.  Very little annotated data is currently available,
especially for languages other than English.  Self-organizing methods offer
the hope that annotated corpora might not be necessary.  Do these methods
really work?  Do we have to choose between annotated corpora and
unannotated corpora?  Can we use both?

The workshop will encourage contributions of innovative research along this
spectrum.  In particular, it will seek work in languages and applications
where appropriately tagged training corpora do not currently exist.
It will also explore what new kinds of corpus annotations (such as discourse
structure, co-reference and sense tagging) would be useful to the community,
and will encourage papers on their development and use in experimental
projects.

The theme will provide an organizing structure to the workshop, and
offer a focus for debate.  However, we expect and will welcome a diverse
set of submissions in all areas of statistical and corpus-based NLP.


PROGRAM CHAIRS:

    Ken Church      - AT&T Bell Laboratories
    David Yarowsky  - University of Pennsylvania


SPONSORS:       LEXIS-NEXIS, Division of Reed and Elsevier, Plc.

         SIGNLL (ACL's special interest group for natural language learning)


FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION:   Authors should submit a full-length paper
(3500-8000 words), either electronically or in hard copy. Electronic
submissions should be mailed to "yarowsky@unagi.cis.upenn.edu", and
must either be (a) plain ascii text, (b) a single postscript file, or
(c) a single latex file following the ACL-95 stylesheet (no separate
figures or .bib files). Hard copy submissions should be mailed to
Ken Church (address below), and should include four (4) copies of
the paper.

REQUIREMENTS: Papers should describe original work. A paper accepted
for presentation cannot be presented or have been presented at any
other meeting. Papers submitted to other conferences will be considered,
as long as this fact is clearly indicated in the submission.

         PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

                        FORMAL GRAMMAR

                          Barcelona
                      August 12-13, 1995
                   in conjunction with the
  European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information


In  1995  the   Seventh  European  Summer  School   in  Logic,
Language  and  Information   is  to  be  held   in  Barcelona.
As  on  previous  occasions  this  meeting  will  serve  as  a
forum for  areas including  computational linguistics,  formal
linguistics,  and the  role  of logic  in grammar  formalisms.
This  year  the  programme includes  a  conference  on  formal
grammar  open  to  all participants  to  present  contemporary
research  in  this  domain.      Themes  of  interest  include
formal  and  computational phonology,  syntax,  semantics  and
pragmatics; logical methods in  linguistics; and foundational,
methodological and architectural issues in grammar.

                      REVIEW OF PAPERS
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submissions  will  be  judged  on  significance, originality,
quality  and  clarity.   Reviewing   will  be  blind  to  the
identities  of  the  authors.   This  requires  that  authors
exercise  some  care  not  to  identify  themselves  in their
papers.  Each  copy  of  the  paper  must  have a title page,
separated  from the body of the paper, including the title of
the paper,  the names and addresses of all authors, a list of
content areas (see above) and any acknowledgments. The second
page should include the same title,  a short abstract of less
than 200 words,  and the exact same  contents areas,  but not
the names nor affiliations of  the  authors.  This  page  may
include text of the paper.  The references should include all
published   literature   relevant  to  the  paper,  including
previous  works  of  the  authors,  but  should  not  include
unpublished works of the authors. When referring to one's own
work,  use  the  third  person. For example, say "previously,
Peter [17] has shown that ...".  Try  to  avoid including any
information in the body of the paper or references that would
identify the authors or their institutions.  Such information
can  be  added  to  the  final   camera-ready   version   for
publication.  Please do not staple the title page to the body
of the paper. Submitted papers must be unpublished.


                         PUBLICATION
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~
The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag (lecture
notes in A.I. series).  Authors  will be required to transfer
copyright of their paper to Springer-Verlag.


                    ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In  the  framework  of the conference three workshops will be
organized:  Applications of Expert  Systems,  Fuzzy Logic and
Neural  Networks   in   Engineering,   and   Applications  of
Artificial Intelligence to Robotics and Vision Systems.  Real
world applications, running systems, and demos are welcome.

===========================================================================

CONFERENCE THEME
	The primary objective of the symposium is to determine the present 
situation of all the sub-areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
especially those related but not limited to, Asian languages and then 
to seek an appropriate direction for extensive research pertaining to 
computer technologies which would assist NLP in the future.  The symposium 
will serve as a forum for linguists, computer scientists, researchers and 
other related parties who have been working on languages of diverse families 
spoken to exchange ideas and information.
	Moreover, as 1995 has been declared the National Information 
Technology Year of Thailand, and 1996 will mark the 50th anniversary of 
H.M. King Bhumipol's reign, the organizing committee on behalf of 
the government of Thailand through the National Electronics and Computer 
Technology Center, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment 
would like to extend an invitation to all who are interested 
to participate in this symposium from August 2-4, 1995.

Subject: Computers and writing conference
Date: Monday, 13 March 1995 3:25PM

Simon noticed the following announcement.  If it's likely to be
well attended by industrial folk, maybe it's a good place to go
in the interests of diversification.  (I'm not sure whether this
is plausible.)  It may also be a good focus for thinking about
overlap between Tech Documentation and Education.
